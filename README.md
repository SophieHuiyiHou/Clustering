# Clustering Analysis Project

This project demonstrates clustering techniques using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It includes cleaning and combining two datasets (`D2_mar.csv` and `D2_apr.csv`), exploratory data analysis, and applying unsupervised clustering to detect patterns.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Contents

- `Clustering.ipynb` â€“ Main notebook with data cleaning, visualization, and clustering steps
- `D2_mar.csv` â€“ March data file
- `D2_apr.csv` â€“ April data file
- `requirement.txt` â€“ Python dependencies
- `README.md` â€“ Project overview

## ðŸ§° Features

- Combines and processes two monthly datasets
- Visualizes data trends using seaborn and matplotlib
- Applies clustering techniques (e.g., K-means or others)
- Shows clustering results with labeled visualizations

## ðŸš€ How to Run
